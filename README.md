# Image-Steganography
This project implements image-based steganography to securely hide and retrieve secret messages within images. Using OpenCV and Tkinter, it provides a user-friendly GUI for encryption and decryption, ensuring lossless data retrieval with password protection. The system enhances secure communication while maintaining the imageâ€™s visual integrity.
